The data file "diabetes.csv" contains data from 768 patients. The data includes 8 attributes (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age) and 1 response variable (Outcome), which has binary values (1 indicating the outcome is diabetes and 0 indicating no diabetes). The entire data was considered as the population for the analysis.

To start, a sample of size 25 was randomly selected from the population. The mean and highest Glucose values of this sample were calculated and compared with the population statistics of the same variable. Bar plots and pie charts were created to visually represent the comparison.

Next, the 98th percentile of the BMI of the sample and the population was determined and compared using bar and pie charts.

 The mean, standard deviation, and percentile for BloodPressure were calculated for each sample and compared with the same statistics from the population. Bar plots and pie charts were created to visually represent the comparison.

All the results were saved under the results folder.
